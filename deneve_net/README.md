This module attempts to experiment with the architecture from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007692">Brendel et al. 2020</a> (see Fig. 1A). Network is trained using Matlab, as authors did originally, but with input signals which can be defined in Python. An adaptation of Matlab code to allow for that is available in <a href=https://github.com/ikharitonov/spikes>this repository</a>. The notebook here deals with generating two noisy sine signals with different frequency coupling, saving inputs as .mat files and loading outputs. After having the network learn different signal couplings, the effect of coupling mismatches can be tested.
