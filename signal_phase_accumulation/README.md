The main idea of this module is to have an oscillating signal, the frequency of which is driven by another signal, then training an neural network to infer this underlying drive.

__generate_motion_and_visualflow.ipynb__ implements this through using the phase accumulation approach (see _generate_variable_sine_ function)
